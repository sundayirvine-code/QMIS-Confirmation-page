# QMIS-Confirmation-page
I have been working at KNEC as an intern for the past 6 months and I have observed that our QMIS(Query Management Information System) was not user friendly leading to a lot of queries from our customers on how to go about various online applications.
I have taken it upon myself to try to improve the user experience on our website which I believe will lead to a reduction of complaints made to the council and also reduce frustration on the part of our clients.
This is a page that contains a form for applying for a confirmation of certificate. The sweetest part of it is the client side form validation that ensures users provide correct data
